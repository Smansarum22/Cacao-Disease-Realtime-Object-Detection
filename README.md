# Cacao-Disease-Realtime-Object-Detection

Background. Cocoa pod rot caused by the fungus Phytophthora palmivora can reduce cocoa plantation productivity by up to 80%. Manual disease detection still relies on visual observation, which is inefficient, especially in large plantation areas. Drone and computer vision technologies offer alternative solutions. Drones can cover wide areas, and with deep learning models such as YOLOv8, disease detection can be automated and accelerated. Objective. This study aims to develop a system that classifies cocoa pods as healthy or infected remotely, to support early detection and improve production efficiency. It also evaluates the impact of confidence scores and model sizes on system performance. Method. The detection system was built using the YOLOv8 algorithm, involving training, validation (comparing the performance of various model sizes and confidence scores), and real-time field testing. Results. The YOLOv8-Nano model with a confidence score of 0.4 was selected as the best-performing model, balancing high accuracy and inference speed. Field testing showed the system achieved 98% detection accuracy on a 15-second video and reduced monitoring time by 42â€“53 times compared to manual observation. Conclusion. The integration of drones with YOLOv8-Nano (confidence score 0.4) is effective for real-time early detection of cocoa pod disease, significantly improving monitoring efficiency and supporting large-scale plantation productivity.
